# CornFedCode
Project Overview & Tech Used

Project Overview
CornFedCode is a full-stack personal/portfolio website that showcases branding, content pages (home, about, services, contact), and a custom backend. The project structure includes static HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend, bundled and managed for production, alongside a Node.js server backend allowing dynamic serving (or simple static-site hosting). The website is organized with separate pages (index, about, services, contact), and includes supporting static assets (CSS, JS, dist folder) to deliver a clean, responsive user experience.
